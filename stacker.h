// New mode, telescope, to use the controller to drive another stepper motor (e.g., for telescope focuser). Only the motor part is used in this mode, camera shutter and AF and microswitches are not used.
// (Though microswitches can be used, if you find a way to attach them to your telescope or whatever other device you are controlling.)
// If you comment out this line, no telescope mode will be available. If you uncomment this line, then during initialization Arduino will read the state of PIN_SHUTTER (by putting it briefly
// into INPUT_PULLUP mode). If the state is LOW (that would happen if the controller is connected to the macro rail, as the pin will be grounded via 500 Ohm relay), the controller
// assumes that we are driving the macro rail; if the state is HIGH (when no relay is grounding the pin), the controller assumes that we are driving the alternatiev device (e.g. telescope), and
// will modify its behaviour accordingly.
// When in telescope mode, current position is stored in a different EEPROM register, so the current position is independently rememberd for the two devices.
// In telescope mode: no calibration, no limiters, no camera AF and shutter.

// all motions moving in the bad (negative) direction at the end will need some BL compensation.
// Using the simplest BL model (assumption: rail physically doesn't move until rewinding the full g.backlash amount,
// and then instantly starts moving; same when moving to the positive direction after moving to the bad direction).
// The algorithm guarantees that every time the rail comes to rest, it is fully BL compensated (so the code coordinate = physical coordinate).
// Should be determined experimentally: too small values will produce visible backlash (two or more frames at the start of the stacking
// sequence will look alsmost identical). For my Velbon Super Mag Slide rail I measured the BL to be ~0.2 mm.
// Set it to zero to disable BL compensation.

// larger than the actual backlash value for the rail movements to be perfectly accurate, the BACKLASH_2 parameter has to have a specific value (not larger, no smaller); if
// your rail backlash changes as a function of the rail angle, position on the rail, camera weight etc., BACKLASH_2 would have to change as well.
// Because it is not practical, your value of BACKLASH_2 should be a compromise, giving reasonable results under normal usage scenario. In any case
// rail reversal (*1) wasn't meant to be a perfectly accurate operation, whereas the standard backlash compensation is.
// Use the BL2_DEBUG mode to find the good value of this parameter. You should convert the displayed value of BL2_DEBUG from microsteps
// to mm, by multiplying by MM_PER_ROTATION/(MOTOR_STEPS*N_MICROSTEPS).

// 5 mm/s seems to be a reasonable compromize, for my motor and rail.
