void backlash()
/*  Monitors the value of the backlash counter BL_counter (updated in motor_control). When it detects that
    BL_counter > 0 (and only when the rail is at rest) it initiates a go_to travel to compensate for backlash.

    This routine should work in concert with go_to() function, where all moves ending in the bad (negative) direction
    should always travel g.backlash further back. The backlash() picks up where go_to() left, after the rail stops, and rewinds
    the rail back in the good direction, to completely compensate the backlash.
